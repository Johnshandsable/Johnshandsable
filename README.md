### Hi there ğŸ‘‹ my name is John!

Currently working on passion projects over the weekends. My time is spent learning the ins and outs of various technologies including Django, GraphQL, and React. With that said, I'd be interested in collaborating on open source projects, anything plant-related, or learning opportunities. 

- ğŸ’¬ Ask me about native plants, coding, or music. 
- ğŸ˜„ Pronouns: he/him
- ğŸŒ± Fun fact: I love native plants. My entire yard is a native wildlife habitat! All the birds. All the bees.
