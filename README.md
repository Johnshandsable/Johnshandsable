### Hi there 👋 my name is John. 

- I’m currently working on passion projects over my weekends and taking some time to find a role as a full-stack developer. 
- I’m currently learning the ins and outs of React, Node/Express, and GraphQL.
- I’d be interested in collaborating on open source projects or anything plant-related. 
- 💬 Ask me about native plants, coding, or music. 
- 📫 I can be reached at Johnshandsable@outlook.com or via Linkedin 
- 😄 Pronouns: he/him
- 🌱 Fun fact: I love native plants. My entire yard is a native wildlife habitat! All the birds. All the bees.
