### Hi there ğŸ‘‹ my name is John!

Currently working on passion projects over the weekends and taking some time to find a role as a full-stack developer. My time is spent learning the ins and outs of React, Node/Express, GraphQL and applying for positions. Additionally, I'm transitioning into using Typescript. With that said, I'd be interested in collaborating on open source projects, anything plant-related, or learning opportunities. 

- ğŸ’¬ Ask me about native plants, coding, or music. 
- ğŸ“« I can be reached at Johnshandsable@outlook.com or via Linkedin at <https://www.linkedin.com/in/john-shands/>
- ğŸ˜„ Pronouns: he/him
- ğŸŒ± Fun fact: I love native plants. My entire yard is a native wildlife habitat! All the birds. All the bees.
